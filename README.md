# Earthquakes and Volcanoes
## By Austin Liu, Afif Khan, Maggie Wang, Hannah Iddir, Hui Zhang, Mohammed Ahmed
Regions near the tectonic boundaries such as Southeast Asia, East Asia, South America, Central America, and South Europe experience higher seismic and volcanic activity due to their geographical positioning. Areas along these zones are prone to devastating destruction. One of the destructive events is volcanos erupting. Volcanos form in this region through magma from the Earths interior rising to the surface, commonly occurring at tectonic plate boundaries. Many countries manage volcanic activity by putting in monitoring and early warning systems. Additionally, they have ongoing public education on this matter and emergency plans such as evacuations and shelters in place. Another one of these destructive events is earthquakes. Many earthquakes occur in high density regions and are one of the natural disasters that cannot be avoided, over time, people have adapted by building earthquake proof infrastructure and improving evacuation plans. However, this is often not possible to do impoverished areas lacking the means of doing either. These high-density areas also have a great discrepancy in wealth and resources, even in advanced countries, recovery can be very uneven because of a range of factors such as lack of resources, income inequality, and government priority. We will choose the following cities as case studies to demonstrate this, all with earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that have occurred recently:
-	The 2010 7.0 Haiti Earthquake in Port-au-Prince (undeveloped)
-	The 2023 7.8 Turkey-Syria Earthquake in Gaziantep, Adiyaman, and Antakya (developing)
-	The 2010 8.8 Chile Earthquake in Santiago and Concepcion (nearly developed)
-	The 2011 9.0 Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in Ishinomaki and Sendai (fully developed)
- Mt. Merapi Volcanic Eruption in Indonesia (developing)
- 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Volcanic Eruption in Tonga (developing)

We have used the following databases to get information on each case study:
-	[NASA](https://data.nasa.gov/dataset/global-earthquake-hazard-distribution-peak-ground-acceleration)
-	[NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/natural-hazards/tsunamis-earthquakes-volcanoes/earthquakes)
-	[USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes)

We summarized the most important data, including the casualties (death toll/injuries), recovery speed (local economy/housing) and development levels through GDP per capita.

The goal of this project was to highlight not just the regions that are hazard zones for earthquakes and Volcanos, but also the slowest to recover and prepare for them. It will also illustrate how geography shapes hazard exposure and why some populations are more vulnerable. This can help users understand the importance of providing aid to countries that need it to better prepare their populations and infrastructure for these events.
